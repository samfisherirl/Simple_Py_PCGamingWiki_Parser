snippet==The stuttering issues suggest that shader compilation management is poorly handled, with shader code compiled the first time it's needed in-game, generating split-second delays throughout the experience.<br>[...]<br>In addition to this issue, there's ''further'' stutter, seemingly tied into background loading.}}</ref><ref>{{Refurl

{{Fixbox
description==Potential fix for stutter and frame rate drops{{cn
date==2022-03-03}}
fix==

* The game is a DirectX 12 title with no shader precompiling. The game will stutter less the more you play as it saves its shaders on your PC. Note that every time you update your drivers, the shader stutter will begin again.

* Forcing Vsync off in the GPU control panel for the game or globally, substantially reduces stutters at the cost of introducing tearing. Setting Vsync to fast turns it off and reduces tearing to imperceptible levels.

* Disable Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator in your Device Manager. To find this, go to your Control Panel, locate Software devices, Right click Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator and click Disable Device.

* Disable Steam Overlay by Right clicking Elden Ring in your Steam Library, choose Properties, Uncheck Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game.

* The game may occasionally freeze up for several moments at a time when using a controller. Uninstall all Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass games that are located in your Windowsapps folder. Update your Xbox App via the Microsoft Store. Reinstall your games via the advanced installation settings located in the General section to another custom game folder. If the Xbox app does not show the advanced installation settings, uninstall it, then reinstall it from the Microsoft Store. Some games, such as Sea of Thieves, do not currently support advanced installation. If all else fails, uninstall the Xbox app and all Xbox games.

* [https://github.com/soupstream/EldenRingStutterFix Potential fix]

* Changing your Power Plan to "Ultimate Performance" might resolve FPS problems.

description==Enable desktop configuration
fix==
* Go to Steam > Controller > Desktop Configuration to open the Steam Controller Configurator.
* Select 'Browse Configs' and apply a configuration of your choosing to use in-game (note: this will also enable the controller in this configuration on your Desktop)
* Exit the Steam Controller Configurator.
* In your Library, right-click on Elden Ring and select 'Properties...'.
* In the controller category, ensure Steam Input is enabled.

description==Upgrade to a newer build of Windows
fix==
* The game seems to require DX12 features not available on some older builds of Windows. Updating to build 21H1 (or at least build 1909 {{cn
date==2022-02-28}}) fixes the issue.
