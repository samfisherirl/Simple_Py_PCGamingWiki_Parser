Python parser for PCgamingwiki

This is very simple and ham-fisted. I find pcgamingwiki's api convoluted compared to mediawiki's overall structure. 
This takes command-line arguments within quotes to return values on pcgamingwiki. 
These values are on new lines and separated by "==". You can easily modify into a dictionary for key,val parsing but Iâ€™m on to the next project.


For now, simply run the release from cmd likethis:

an output file of "output.txt" contains all values. 

Secondarily, you can simple run and a pop up window will request "Enter game"
